            <h1>How It Works</h1>

            <br />

            <p class="mainp">UXShore has developed a process to build your website from start to finish in 5 stages. This process is designed for the convenience of our clients.</p>

            <br />

            <h4>Stage 1</h4>

            <p class="mainp">The first stage of the development process is the initial point of contact with you (our client). This point of contact can be through email, calling or in-person.</p>

            <br />
              
            <h4>Stage 2</h4>

            <p class="mainp">This stage is where we will contact you to request information about your website. For example, we will ask how you will like to have the website designed, if you have any media you would like to have on the website, and any other requests you might have.</p>

            <br />
              
            <h4>Stage 3</h4>

            <p class="mainp">We will get started on stage 3 as soon as we have all the information about the website that we need. Stage 3 is the development stage. This is where the coders will immediately begin writing the unique code for your website. This will be the longest stage and could take up to 14 business days to finish (depending on the size of the website).</p>

            <br />

            <h4>Stage 4</h4>

            <p class="mainp">Once the development process is done, we will send you an email. This email will inform you that the website has been developed. The email will also have a link to request any revisions that you would like done on the website. You have 7 days after receiving this email to submit a Revisions Request Form.</p>

            <br />

            <h4>Stage 5</h4>

            <p class="mainp">Published! Stage 5 is the final stage. Your website will be published and live on the internet after this stage. At this point, we will collect your final payment. After we recieve payment this ticket will close and any major revisions / changes will require a Revisions Request Form to proceed.</p>
